# REGRESSION ANALYSIS with LINEAR REGRESSION and XGBOOST

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebook implementations showcasing regression analysis using:

1. Linear Regression

2. XGBoost Regression

---

## Overview

The notebooks analyze the `Ecommerce Customers` dataset, performing predictive modeling to determine customer behavior and associated trends.

### Files
- `linear_reg.ipynb`: Demonstrates regression using the LinearRegression model from Scikit-Learn.

- `xgboost_reg.ipynb`: Implements regression using the XGBoost libraryâ€™s XGBRegressor.

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebooks, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python ilbraries:
    - pandas
    - numpy
    - seaborn
    - sci-kit
    - xgboost
  
You can install the necessary libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
```

## Usage

### 1. Linear Regression

The `linear_reg.ipynb` notebook covers:

- Data preprocessing and exploration.

- Building a regression model using LinearRegression from Scikit-Learn.

- Evaluating model performance with metrics like Mean Squared Error and R-squared.

### 2. XGBoost Regression

The `xgboost_reg.ipynb` notebook includes:

- Data preprocessing and exploration.

- Building a regression model using XGBRegressor from the XGBoost library.

- Fine-tuning the model with hyperparameter optimization.

- Evaluating performance metrics for comparison with the linear regression model.
